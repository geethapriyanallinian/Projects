Technical Approach:
Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization: Split the review text into individual words or subword tokens.
Stopword Removal: Remove common, unimportant words (e.g., "and", "the").
Lemmatization: Convert words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" to "run").
TF-IDF Vectorization: Convert the review text into a matrix of numerical features, capturing the importance of words in each review.
Modeling:
Topic Modeling (LDA):
Apply LDA or NMF to extract topics from the review text.
Each review will be associated with one or more topics based on the word distribution across topics.
Clustering:
Apply K-Means or DBSCAN to group similar reviews based on their content.
Visualize clusters using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or PCA.
Fake Review Classification:
Use BERT or LSTM for classification tasks. BERT provides rich context for each review, making it highly effective for classifying fake vs. real reviews.
Evaluation: Use classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Flask API for Real-Time Inference:
Build a Flask API that accepts review text and returns the fake/real classification, sentiment, and identified topic.
Docker for Deployment:
Containerize the entire solution using Docker to ensure the application can be easily deployed on any platform.
